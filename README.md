# InfixConversions

A C# program that converts mathematical expressions written in infix notation to prefix and postfix notation, and evaluates them using Expression Trees. The program will output a summary report to the console, as well as generate an XML file that contains the same information as the summary report.


Infix notation: most commonly used to represent a mathematical expression - Example: (a-b) * c

Prefix notation: operators precede the operands - Example *-abc

Postfix notation: operators are preceded by operands - Example ab-c*
