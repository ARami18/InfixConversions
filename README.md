# InfixConversions

A C# program that converts mathematical expressions written in infix notation to prefix and postfix notation, and evaluates them using Expression Trees.

Infix notation: most commonly used to represent a mathematical expression - Example: (a-b) * c

Prefix notation: operators precede the operands - Example *-abc

Postfix notation: operators are preceded by operands - Example ab-c*
